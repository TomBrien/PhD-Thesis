\section{Introduction}\label{sec:testbeds_Introduction}
As is the case with all ultra-sensitive mid- to far-infrared detectors \parencite[as described by][]{Richards1994}, the silicon cold-electron bolometer requires cooling to extremely low temperatures in order to operate. This requirement can be seen from the description of cold-electron bolometers given in Chapter~\ref{cha:theory}. Since these detectors incorporate superconducting contacts to select only the most energetic (i.e. the hottest) electrons from the detector's absorber, it is important that the superconductor is cooled sufficiently that the superconducting energy gap is close to its maximum. For the detectors studied in this work, which used aluminium contacts, it was found  that cooling to approximately $\sim \nicefrac{T_{c}\,}{4}$ ($300~\mathrm{mK}$) allowed the detector to operate reasonably. However, in order to arrive at as complete a study as possible, it was important to measure the electrical properties of the detectors to as low a temperature as possible.
\par 
To this end, several different cryogenic systems have been used in the course of this work. The most significant of these (those in which results presented in this thesis were taken) were: an \glsfirst{acr:ADR} housed in a liquid helium cryostat, a He10 sorption refrigerator housed in a cryostat with a pulse tube cooler, and a He7 sorption refrigerator mounted on the cold plate of a liquid helium cryostat.\footnote{Note: He7 and He10 here do not denote strange and exotic isotopes of helium but instead the combination of pumps which make up the soprtion refrigerator. Isotopes have been typeset with a leading superscript (i.e. \ce{^{4}He}). A He7 refrigerator contains one \ce{^{4}He} pump and a \ce{^{3}He} pump, a He10 refrigerator consists of a He7 refrigerator used as a buffer stage for a second \ce{^{3}He} pump.} The reason for the use of these numerous systems was essentially due to availability and the associated costs of liquid helium. Primary measurements were carried out in the pulse tube cooled cryostat since this had lower running costs (due to not requiring a reservoir of liquid helium to be maintained). However (as will be seen later in this chapter), the system was not designed with the DC readout of sensitive detectors in mind and resulted in lower quality data than would have been desired; however, it did provide a useful facility for ascertaining whether or not a device was functional. The two other systems, both of which required the supply of liquid helium, were used for very specific purposes. The \glstext{acr:ADR} system was used to measure devices at extremely low temperatures (the minimum temperature achieved with this system was $80~\mathrm{mK}$), whereas the system containing a He7 refrigerator contained optical windows, horns and filters to allow the detector to observe external sources. This chapter will cover the operational principles, along with the cryogenic performance and suitability for the required measurements of each of these systems.

\section{Sorption Refrigerators}\label{sec:sorptionRefrigerators}
Sorption refrigerators operate by the adsorption and desorption of a working gas (helium in the case of systems intended to operate at cryogenic temperatures) from a surface or other material (most commonly activated charcoal). The released gas flows through a pipe until it is cooled by a condensation point and liquified. This liquid is collected in a stage called the evaporator. The activated charcoal is then cooled, causing the gas evaporating from the liquid in the evaporator to become reattached to the charcoal, thus decreasing the pressure in the system and thus the temperature of the liquid in the evaporator. A simplified model of a single-stage sorption refrigerator is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sorptionPumpCrossSec}
\begin{figure}[tb]

\label{fig:sorptionPumpCrossSec}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\par 
In order to understand a sorption refrigerator, it is perhaps easiest to consider the typical procedure followed to cycle such a system. The general procedure is as follows:
\begin{description}
\item[Cool system to working temperature.] In order to function, the condensing stage of the system must be cooled to the boiling point of the working gas (this is $4.2~\mathrm{K}$ for \ce{^{4}He}). This is performed by either: filling the cryostat in which the refrigerator is housed with liquid helium (in the case of \textit{wet} systems) or switching on the cryostat's mechanical cooler (for \textit{dry} systems) and waiting for all the parts of the system to thermalise.
\item[Heat the charcoal in the pump.] The pump is heated (usually via a film resistor mounted to the outside of the pump) causing the gas to be released from the activated charcoal (sometimes referred to as the \textit{getter}). As the charcoal is heated to above $10~\mathrm{K}$, helium will begin to be released and by $25~\mathrm{K}$ the vast majority will have been released.
\item[Helium condenses.] Increasing the temperature further causes the pressure within the refrigerator to increase, causing the gas to come into contact with the condenser, where it will condense. This liquid will then collect in the evaporator (situated beneath the condenser).
\item[Charcoal cooled.] The charcoal in the pump is then cooled again. This is performed using a heat switch. The heat switch has one side connected to the pump and the other to the cold plate of the cryostat.\footnote{The most common type of heat switch used in conjuncture with sorption refrigerators is the gas-gap heat switch. This can be thought of simply as a small sorption refrigerator. The heat switch is made of two copper caps connected by an extremely thin-walled stainless steel tube (which has negligible thermal conduction); attached to this, via a second thin tube, is a cylinder containing a charcoal getter. The heat switch also contains helium gas. When the switch is open (off), the helium is attached to the getter and there is little or no thermal conduction between the two copper caps. The heat switch is closed (switched on) by heating the charcoal, causing the helium to be released into the stainless steel tube, which results in the thermal conduction between the two copper caps increasing substantially.} The closing of the heat switch creates a link between the pump and the cold plate of the cryostat and thus cools the pump.
\item[Pressure reduces.] As the charcoal in the pump cools to below $25~\mathrm{K}$, it is once again able to attract and hold gas. This means that as helium molecules evaporate from the liquid, they become attached to the activated charcoal (through adsorption) which causes the pressure in the system to reduce. This, in turn, lowers the temperature of the liquid in the evaporator along with the walls of the evaporator.

\end{description}

\par
The above process is for a single-stage helium-4 sorption refrigerator; such systems are capable of achieving temperatures of around $1~\mathrm{K}$ at the external walls of the evaporator. To achieve sub-Kelvin temperatures with a sorption refrigerator, one must use helium-3 as the working gas; this necessitates that the condensation point must be at a lower temperature (\ce{^{3}He} has a critical point of $3.3~\mathrm{K}$). 
\par 
In order to meet this requirement, it is common practice to use a helium-4 pump as a buffer stage to cool a condensation point on a helium-3 pump (this is what is referred to as a He7 system).\footnote{It is worth mentioning that as mechanical cooling technology (e.g. pulse tubes) is improving, these systems can, under low to medium thermal loads, offer sufficiently low temperatures to cycle a helium-3 sorption cooler directly, without the need of a buffer stage.} This technique was first reported by \textcite{DallOglio1991} who, at the time, achieved a minimum temperature of $300~\mathrm{mK}$ at the evaporator of the \ce{^{3}He} pump.
\par 
Further cooling can be achieved with sorption refrigerators by using the He7 system described above to a cool a further helium-3 pump (thus making a He10 system). This type of system was first introduced by \textcite{Bhatia2000} who described a system capable of achieving a minimum temperature of $234~\mathrm{mK}$ for 20 hours under minimal thermal loading ($\approx 0.9~\mathrm{\upmu W}$) or $242~\mathrm{mK}$ for 12 hours under a total thermal load of $3.9~\mathrm{\upmu W}$. Further improvements to the design of such systems, coupled with the lower starting temperatures offered by pulse tube coolers, has resulted in minimum operating temperatures of lower than $220~\mathrm{mK}$ being achieved under realistic experimental thermal loading.

\section{Adiabatic Demagnetisation Refrigeration}\label{sec:ADR}
Adiabatic Demagnetisation Refrigeration utilises changes in entropy in a working medium (a salt pill) which, depending on the stage of the refrigeration cycle, is either connected to, or isolated from, a heat sink. As opposed to the sorption refrigerators previously described, the heat switch technology used with adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerators (at least the systems based at Cardiff) are mechanical heat switches. This type of heat switch uses moving parts to make physical contact between two sides of the switch. This results in the open (off) state of the switch having a much lower heat flow than in the case of the gas-gap heat switch previously mentioned. A disadvantage of this technology is that since some degree of mechanical motion is required, the automation of the switch is more complicated, requiring either solenoid- or motor-controlled switches. A simplified model of a simple adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ADR}. It is worth noting that it is common practice to encompass the magnet with a magnetic shield (not shown), so as to reduce stray magnetic fields which may interfere with measurements.
\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{figures/ADR}
\caption[Simplified model of a simple single-stage adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator]{Simplified model of a simple single-stage adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator. The 4-Kelvin plate of the cryostat is cooled by either a liquid-helium reservoir or a mechanical cooler (not shown in either case).}
\label{fig:ADR}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\par 
As before, it is beneficial when discussing the principles involved in adiabatic demagnetisation refrigeration to follow the thermal cycle of such a system. A typical cycling procedure for a system such as the one illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ADR} is:
\begin{description}
\item[Magnetic field increased.] With the heat switch closed, the current through the magnet is increased, causing the salt pill to be subjected to an greater magnetic field. This field causes the magnetic dipoles within the salt pill to align. This places the salt in a more ordered state, lowering its entropy. Thermal energy added to the salt pill is removed to the 4-Kelvin heat sink.
\item[Heat switch opened.] With the peak magnetic field (typically up to $4~\mathrm{T}$) still applied, the heat switch is opened. This disconnects the salt pill (and the attached cold stage) from the 4-Kelvin heat sink, placing these components in a adiabatic state.
\item[Magnetic field decreased.] The current supplied to the magnet is lowered gradually to decrease the magnetic field. This allows the magnetic dipoles within the salt pill to fall out of alignment thus creating a more disordered state. This produces cooling since, now that the system has been placed in a adiabatic state, the total entropy cannot change. To accommodate the disorder (increased entropy) introduced by the removal of the magnetic field, the temperature of the salt pill falls (lowering the entropy), maintaining the entropy at a constant level.
\end{description}
\par 
Once the magnetic field has been reduced once again to zero, the system will slowly heat up, since the dipoles are free to relax into a disordered state. This means that, at zero field, an adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator does have zero cooling power. Due to this, when adiabatic demagnetisation refrigeration is utilised for applications requiring a constant temperature to be maintained for a period of time, it is necessary to decrease the field to a level corresponding to the required level and hold the field at this level. As the salt pill slowly warms, the field can be reduced further to compensate. Once the field has reached zero, no further cooling is available and a rise in the salt pill's temperature becomes inevitable. The longer hold time associated with this technique was not required for the measurements taken for this work and, as such, it was sufficient to simply reduce the magnetic field to zero and allow the salt pill (and the attached cold stage) to gradually warm.
\par
The minimum achievable temperature of an adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator is predominately governed by two factors: the maximum field applied to the salt pill (i.e. the degree of order introduced in the non-adiabatic state) and the salt used to construct the salt pill\footnote{At this point it is worth mentioning that the depiction of a salt pill shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ADR} is extremely simplified. For a more complete description of these components see, for example, \textcite{Hagmann1994}.}; some of the  most prolifically used salts are: chromic caesium alum (CCA), ferric ammonium alum (FAA), and gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG); each of these has its own optimum operation temperature. The initial temperature of the refrigerator also contributes greatly towards the minimum achievable temperature but here it assumed that this is determined by the thermal reservoir (e.g. liquid helium) and cannot be improved upon.
\par 
In order to achieve temperatures below $100~\mathrm{mK}$, it is necessary to use a system containing multiple salt pills. Such a two-stage system was first described by \textcite{Hagmann1994b}, which is not dissimilar to the system used for parts of this work. The concept of such a system is, conceptually, similar to that described for sorption refrigerators in the previous chapter. The first salt pill acts as a buffer stage for any thermal loads (such as wiring) to the coldest stage. Both stages can be cycled simultaneously, since the first stage does not need to reduce the temperature of the second below any critical temperature before cycling is possible (as is the case for sorption refrigerators); instead it simply acts to reduce the thermal load on the second stage. This means that only one magnet is required to run both stages. The system used in this work (manufactured by Janis Cryogenics) used gadolinium gallium garnet for the first stage and ferric ammonium alum for the second stage. These stages were capable of achieving minimum temperatures of $1~\mathrm{K}$ and $70~\mathrm{mK}$ respectively.

\section{Systems Used in This Work}\label{sec:cryostats}
Three systems have been used for the majority of the low-temperature measurements carried out in the course of this work. These were: a liquid-helium cryostat housing a two-stage adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator; a cryostat (affectionately known as Aloysius\footnote{This cryostat was affectionately known as Aloysius since---due being large, orange and involving several hose lines for the pulse tube cooler---it possibly bore something of a resemblance to the character Aloysius Snufflepagus in \textit{Sesame Street} \parencite[see][]{SesameWWW}.}) with a pulse-tube cooler upon which a He10 sorption refrigerator was mounted; and a liquid-helium cryostat, containing  windows to facilitate optical measurements, in which a He7 sorption refrigerator was mounted. Each of these systems served a specific role, such as: facilitating optical measurement of detectors or characterisation at extremely low temperatures. Each of these system is discussed in greater detail in the following subsections.
%
\subsection{Pulse Tube Cooled Cryostat with He10 Sorption Refrigerator}
\label{ssec:Aloysius}
The first system used to characterise Silicon Cold Electron Bolometers was a pulse tube cooled cryostat incorporating a He10 sorption refrigerator. This system had a large cold plate ($260~\mathrm{mm}$ in diameter), which could be cooled to a minimum temperature of $220~\mathrm{mK}$, which could be maintained for more than 48 hours. The system also contained a set of windows to enable the measurement of a detector's response to an external source. These windows were not used, for the most part, however, since an alternative system (discussed later in this section) enable a much more complete optical study of a detector.
\par 
This cryostat was mainly used for measurements such as the initial verification of the device's function (i.e. whether tunnelling contacts to the silicon absorber had formed correctly), along with dark characterisation of the device (i.e. measuring the current-voltage relationship of the detector at various bath temperatures). It is worth mentioning that pulse tube cooler based cryogenic systems can contribute  additional, undesired, components when measuring noise spectra. These are caused by the pulsing of the mechanical cooler introducing movement at various stages of the cryostat. This movement can cause any of the following: thermal oscillations, movement of wiring (causing electrical variations through either changes to the wiring's capacitance or through induction), or alternations to the optical alignment of components. Clearly, in order to accurately measure the performance of any device mounted within such a system, it is vital not only to discover the magnitude of these effects but also to reduce their presence as much as possible. The various effects of microphonics, along with a considerably more detailed explanation of their introduction is given by \textcite{Bhatia1999}. In order to reduce the effect of these microphonics, some form of dampening is required to reduce the force exerted on the various stages of the cryostat.
\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height = 0.5\textheight]{figures/Aloysius1920}
\caption[Computer-generated model of Aloysius cryostat]{Computer-generated model of Aloysius cryostat. Along with the various sorption pumps and heat switches the damping stages can also be seen; these are (from top to bottom) the (black) rubber rings via which the pulse tube system is mounted to the cryostat, the bent copper-shim springs, the copper braid connecting the $65~\mathrm{K}$ stage of the pulse tube cooler the plate and copper shim connecting the condenser of the second \ce{^{3}He} sorption pump to the final cold plate.}
\label{fig:Aloysius}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 1.0\textwidth]{figures/AloysiusFilters}
\caption[Filters used for optical measurement in Aloysius]{Filters mounted at various stages of the Aloysius cryostat for optical measurements.

\label{fig:AloysiusFilters}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\par 
In the case of this system, microphonics have been reduced by the deployment of four damping stages. Firstly, the pulse tube cooler's motor is electrically decoupled from the cryostat itself; this is performed by sitting the motor on a layer of plastic and by adding PTFE spacers to the lines between the motor and the pulse tube head; on the outside of the cryostat, instead of mounting the pulse tube cooler head directly to the outer vacuum-can, a number of rubber spacer rings (shore hardness 40) are placed between the cryostat and the head, these are sufficiently clamped to ensure a hermetic seal but allow a degree of movement to absorb some of the vibrational energy. Secondly, at the first stage of the pulse tube cooler (nominally at $65~\mathrm{K}$) the pulse tube cooler is connected to the cold plate via multiple pieces of thin copper shim bent into a c-shape; these act like springs, dampening any vibration, while still creating a good thermal link between the pulse tube cooler and the plate. At the second stage of the pulse tube cooler (nominally $3\mbox{--}4.2~\mathrm{K}$), a similar technique is used whereby the pulse tube cooler and the cold plate are connected via multiple strands of copper braid; this again affords a good thermal link while damping vibrations. Finally, the coldest stage of the system (that cooled by the second \ce{^{3}He} pump of the He10 sorption cooler) is connected to the pump via more copper shim (similar to that described earlier). All the cold plates of the system, with the exception of the coldest stage, are connected to the cryostat's outter vacuum shield by hollow stainless-steel supports with thin (compared to their length) walls. The coldest stage uses rigid supports containing sapphire-sapphire contacts \parencite[these have been described by][]{Bintley2007}. A computer-generated model of this system, showing these features along with various other components can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:Aloysius}.
\par 
For optical measurements in this system, a set of metal-mesh filters \parencite[as described by][]{Ade2006} were used. These not only reduced the thermal load on the colder stages of the cryostat (those with the least cooling power) but also reduced the out-of-band power on the detector (i.e. radiation with frequencies not of interest for the study being carried out). The transmission profiles of these filters can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:AloysiusFilters}. An additional band-pass filter with 3-dB bandwidth of $50~\mathrm{GHz}$ centred around $150~\mathrm{GHz}$ was also used. This was mounted on the front of the detector holder and is not shown in Figure~\ref{fig:AloysiusFilters}.
%
\subsection{Liquid Helium Cryostat with Adiabatic Demagnetisation Refrigerator}
\label{ssec:ADR}
The second system used to characterise Silicon Cold Electron Bolometers was a liquid helium cryostat including an adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator. This system offered the ability to measure the current-voltage characteristics of detectors down to a bath temperature of $80~\mathrm{mK}$. The temperature of the cold plate was controlled by varying the magnetic field  applied to the paramagnetic salt. Testing in this system was limited due to an inability to perform optical measurements and the high running cost associated with the system (the adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator was housed in a medium sized cryostat and required a large amount of liquid helium in order to be cycled). This system is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ADRphoto}.
\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height = 0.4\textheight]{figures/ADRphoto}
\caption[Photograph of the cryostat housing the adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator used for testing detectors]{Photograph of the cryostat housing the adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator used for testing detectors. The cold fingers of the two stages of the refrigerator can be seen protruding from the top and the left of the aluminium support structure; the minimum achievable temperature of these was $1~\mathrm{K}$ and $70~\mathrm{mK}$ respectively.}
\label{fig:ADRphoto}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\par 
Not shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ADRphoto} is the stage upon which the device was mounted. In normal circumstances, this was clamped to the 80-mK cold finger (the upper of the two gold plated rods seen emerging from the left of the aluminium support structure in Figure~\ref{fig:ADRphoto}). Due to the magnetic fields used to thermally cycle the adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator, this stage was surrounded by a shield, plated using tin-lead solder ($60~\%$, lead $40~\%$ tin). Tin-lead is a superconductor and thus expels magnetic fields through the Meissner effect. In the ratio used, tin-lead solder has a superconducting transition temperature of $\sim 7~\mathrm{K}$; it was important that the shield is effective above the operational temperature of the adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator's magnet to ensure that magnetic fields did not become trapped within the shield.
%
\subsection{Liquid Helium Cryostat with He7 sorption refrigerator}
\label{ssec:CookieMonster}
The final system used to characterise detectors was a second liquid helium cryostat, this time with a He7 sorption refrigerator. This system was used for the vast majority of optical measurements taken, including measuring the spectral response of the detector. This system was well suited to such measurements, due to the inclusion a set of back-to-back horns, which produced a well defined beam of radiation at the detector stage.
\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 1.0\textwidth]{figures/CookieMonsterFilters}
\caption[Filter profile of filters used in the optical measurement cryostat]{Filter profile of filters used in optical measurement cryostat. Red---$12~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ low-pass edge filter mounted on the back-to-back horns at $4.2~\mathrm{K}$; blue---$10~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ low-pass edge filter mounted on the device holder at $350~\mathrm{mK}$. A set of thermal blockers were also used to reduce the power load on the cold stage of the cryostat; these were close to $100~\%$ transparent at the frequencies shown and, as such, have not been included.}
\label{fig:CookieMonsterFilters}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\par 
As was the case with the Aloysius system, a number of filters were used to remove the out-of-band radiation, these are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CookieMonsterFilters}. The vacuum jacket of the cryostat contained a large ($90~\mathrm{mm}$) ultra-high molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) window. This blocked the visible and near-infrared light, as well as ensuring that the vacuum was maintained. The 77-K and 4-K shields contained thermal-blocking filters; these are close to $100~\%$ transparent in the frequency range shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CookieMonsterFilters} and, as such, the profiles of these have not been plotted. In front of the back-to-back horns (at $4.2~\mathrm{K}$ but after the thermal blocker), a $12~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ low-pass edge filter was used (this is the red line in Figure~\ref{fig:CookieMonsterFilters}). The device holder, which was mounted on the $350~\mathrm{mK}$ stage of the cryostat, was fitted with a $10~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ low-pass edge filter. No bandpass filters were used to further reduce the spectral range of the incident radiation, since this would obviously prohibit any meaningful study of a detector's spectral response.
\begin{figure}[tb]

\end{figure}
\par
The key optical components in this system were a pair of back-to-back corrugated horns, these were mounted at $4.2~\mathrm{mK}$ in a shield surrounding the 350-mK detector stage. These back-to-back horns produced an excellent Gaussian beam with low side-lobes. This horn arrangement is very similar to that used on \textit{Planck}'s HFI instrument as described by \textcite{Maffei2010}. A simplistic schematic of the optical configuration of this cryostat is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CookieMonsterOptics}.

\end{figure}
A photograph of this system, in which the outer UHMWPE window can be seen, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CookieMonster}.

\section{Detector Holder}\label{sec:detectorHolder}
In order for the detectors to be characterised, they needed to be mounted in a holder which not only held them firmly in place but also facilitated easy electrical connections, along with ensuring that only desired radiation was incident on the detector. Such a holder was manufactured in-house by a computer-numerical-control mill. The holder (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:deviceHolder}) included an aperture through which light could enter the holder for optical testing; a metal-mesh filter was clamped behind the aperture. For dark measurement, the filter could be replaced by a blank.
\par 
The various components of the holder all included lipped edges, which ensured that the holder was reasonably light-tight. A Teflon ring was used to clamp the silicon lens in place, this ring also ensured the lens was correctly aligned. A printed circuit board, wired to a micro-miniature D-type connector, allowed for simple connection to the detector holder. The electrical connection from the connector to the detector itself was completed by aluminium wire bonds between the printed circuit board and the detector.\footnote{The circuit board was gold plated to make the wire bonds more reliable.} The detector was secured in the holder via careful glueing, with GE varnish, to a piece of silicon (matched to the lens), which, in turn, was glued to the rear of the circuit board. When glueing the detector to this silicon, it was important to ensure that the GE varnish was only present at the edges and did not seep under the detector chip, since this would interfere with the radiation incident on the detector (which was rear-illuminated through the silicon substrate). A computer-generated model of the device holder can be seen in Figures~\ref{fig:detectorHolder_exploded} and \ref{fig:detectorHolder_cross}, which show an exploded view of the various components of the holder (including the detector chip itself) and a cross-section of the fully assembled holder.
